# Health, socioeconomic factors and COVID-19
Our life is currently impacted by COVID-19.  We wanted to use our skills to demonstrate current real-world problems and create our own dashboard to present information about our research and analysis on COVID-19.

- Source of data
  - <https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data> : For visuals and presentation
  - <https://www.kaggle.com/johnjdavisiv/us-counties-covid19-weather-sociohealth-data> : NYT data plus health, socioeconomic data

- Database: PostgreSQL

- Data exploration by Tableau
  - Analysis of case and death number in counties revealed difference in fatality rate (death per case)

## What socioeconomic factors have an effect on the fatality rate of COVID-19?  
- Use machine learning to learn which health, socioeconomic factors have on COVID-19 fatality rate
  - Data preprocessing needed for ML
  - Health and socioeconomic features were selected
  - The counties that have a fatality rate higher than the national fatality rate was classified as "high-risk" counties
  - Select top 10 features increasing the risk
  - Compare different ML methods
