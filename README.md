# Health, socioeconomic factors and COVID-19
Our life is currently impacted by COVID-19.  We wanted to use our skills to demonstrate current real-world problems and create our own dashboard to present information about our research and analysis on COVID-19.

- Source of data
  - <https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data> : For visuals and presentation
  - <https://www.kaggle.com/johnjdavisiv/us-counties-covid19-weather-sociohealth-data> : NYT data plus health, socioeconomic data

- Database: PostgreSQL

- Data exploration 
  - Analysis of case and death number in counties revealed difference in fatality rate (death per case)

## What socioeconomic factors have an effect on the fatality rate of COVID-19?  
- Use machine learning to learn which health, socioeconomic factors have on COVID-19 fatality rate
  - Compare different ML algorithms 
  - 

Simply thinking, we would expect a similar fatality rate across the nation, however, our data analysis shows some areas with noticeably higher fatality rates and other areas with very low fatality rates. In order to understand the factors leading to this variability, we decided to look into the socioeconomic and health factors in different geographical area.
